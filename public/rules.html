                    Two players will play 3 rounds for a certain question and each player will have to choose to either 
                    cooperate or defect without any communication between two players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each player will get a certain amount of time (eg. 30 seconds) to decide whether they choose to cooperate or defect. After time limit, the computer will choose randomly for that player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When two cards are on the board, the cards will flip and show what both players have chosen.

                    1) Each player will compete to get the maximum score and the player who gets the maximum score
                    after all the questions win.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Each player will try to get the same total scores as the other player after all the questions.
